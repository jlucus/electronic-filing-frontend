# Schedule A

### Question

What are the names of every owner, compensated officer, and employee in the firm who lobbied City Officials during the 30 calendar days prior to registration or is expected to lobby City Officials during the year? 

[ONLY IF AMENDMENT] You may delete lobbyists who will no longer be lobbying for your clients. Deleted lobbyists will appear on Schedule D, which will be shown to you for review befor submission.

### Help
*	List the first and last name of every individual in the firm who:	* has lobbied a City Official within the past 30 calendar days, or	* the firm reasonably anticipates will engage in lobbying the City later in the year.
	*	A person listed on Schedule A is considered a “lobbyist” even if he or she has not yet had a lobbying contact.*	If an individual not identified on Schedule A starts lobbying City Officials, the firm will have to file an amendment **within ten calendar days** to report that individual as a lobbyist. When amending, in addition to identifying the individual as a lobbyist on Schedule A, make sure you report any fundraising activities, campaign contracts, and City contracts for that individual on Schedule C.*	Including the name of prospective lobbyists on the Registration Form enables the firm to meet its disclosure obligations without having to amend the form each time another person in the firm starts lobbying the City.

[ONLY IF AMENDMENT]

* You are not required to remove a lobbyist who may lobby for the firm later in the year.
* If you remove a lobbyist and that individual lobbies the City for your firm later in the year, you will have to file another amendment to the Registration Form and pay another registration fee for re- registering that lobbyist.--

# Schedule B
## Top Level
### Question
What are the names, telephone number, and address of clients for whom the firm has lobbied the City Officials on behalf of? Please note this would be any client during the 30 calendar days prior to registration or for whom the firm anticipates lobbying the City during the calendar year. 

[ONLY IF AMENDMENT]
You may delete clients for whom you are no longer providing lobbying services for.### Help

* A “client” is defined as “any person who provides compensation to a lobbying firm for the purpose of influencing a municipal decision, and any person on whose behalf lobbying is performed by a lobbying firm.” Thus, the term “client” includes any the person who pays the firm to lobby, and also includes any person who does not pay the firm but who for whom the firm lobbies. If a firm has met the registration threshold, i.e., it has earned $1 or more for one or more lobbying contacts, it must disclose all of its clients, including its pro bono clients, for which it is lobbying the City. 
* A “client” also includes any person who retains a firm to engage in lobbying activities pursuant to a contingency agreement, even if the lobbying efforts are unsuccessful and no fees are received.

[ONLY IF AMENDMENT]
* You are not required to remove a client if the firm may lobby on behalf of that client later in the year.
* If you remove a client now, and the firm lobbies on behalf of that client later in the year, you will have to file another amendment to this form, and pay another registration fee for re-registering that client.


## Nature and Purpose of Client's Business

### Question
What is the nature or purpose of the Client’s business? For example, “building contractor” or “wireless telecommunications vendors”
### Help
* Describe the client in sufficient detail to inform the public of the nature and purpose of the client’s business.


## Specific or General Municipal Decision
### Question
What municipal decision(s) is the Lobbying Firm currently seeking to influence on behalf of this Client? Use the Add button to add additional decisions.

### Help

* Describe either the:
	* specific municipal decision for which the firm was retained (e.g., Living Wage Ordinance), or	* the general types of municipal decisions for which the firm was retained (e.g., matters relating to City storm drain pollution).* The descriptions you provide will be automatically entered into your firm’s Quarterly Disclosure Reports. If you provide general information regarding a municipal decision on your Registration Form, more specific information concerning that decision must be added to the applicable Quarterly Disclosure Report.
### Sub-question: Outcomes Thought
#### Question
What is the Outcome the client is seeking? For example, “passage of the Living Wage Ordinance,” or “the adoption of stricter laws and policies designed to reduce storm drain pollution.”

## If the client is ...
### Question
Is your client a coalition or membership organization? 

A client is a coalition or membership organization if they have paid, or agreed to pay, at least $1,000 to the firm for lobbying activities performed on behalf of the coalition or organization with regard to a specific municipal decision.

### Help

* An example of a Coalition reporting: Bill is a restaurant owner who organizes Citizens for a Brighter Future, a coalition that supports a City Ordinance designed to reduce crime in the Gaslamp Quarter by increasing the number of streetlights. Bill convinces a dozen other restaurant owners to join the coalition, and he takes up a collection to hire a lobbyist. Most of the owners contribute between $100 and $500 to retain the lobbyist. Bill contributes $5,000. When the lobbying firm reports its clients, it will disclose that its client is Citizens for a Brighter Future, and will also identify Bill, whose payment for the firm’s lobbying services exceeds the $1,000 reporting threshold.

* If a coalition member does not meet the $1,000 threshold when the Registration Form is filed, but later makes, or agrees to make, a payment that would cause the member to reach that threshold, the firm must file an amendment to the form to disclose the identity of that member.

* Note: Schedule B must be amended within ten calendar days if the firm starts lobbying: (1) for a new client or (2) on a new municipal decision for a client that is already registered.

# Schedule C - 1 Fundraising Activities

### Question

What are the names of each owner, compensated officer, and lobbyist in the firm who engaged in “fundraising activities” for a current elected City Official or a committee primarily formed to support a current elected City Official and the name of the current elected official they fundraised for? Please list all who did so in the last 2 years. 


### Help

* The two year period is based on when the firm registers, except that when filing an amendment to add a new owner, compensated officer, or lobbyist the two year period for the added person is based on the date of the amendment.
* Do not report fundraising activities for a candidate who lost or withdrew from the election.* “Fundraising activity” means soliciting, or directing others to solicit, campaign contributions from one or more contributors, either personally or by hosting or sponsoring a fundraising event, and either:
 	1.	personally delivering $2,000 or more in contributions to a candidate or a candidate’s controlled committee, or a committee primarily formed to support a candidate, or
 		2.	taking credit for the contribution by either personally delivering $2,000 or more in contributions to a candidate committee, or identifying yourself to a candidate committee as having any degree of responsibility for it receiving $2,000 or more in contributions as a result of that solicitation.
	*	When determining whether or not someone has reached the $2,000 threshold, keep in mind that the amount of contributions attributable to an individual is the total amount raised, even if that individual was one of several persons involved in a fundraising effort. Do not divide the total amount raised by the number of persons involved in the fundraising activities.

* For purposes of the above rules, a “candidate committee” means any of the following: 	1.	a City candidate’s election campaign committee; 	2.	a City candidate’s controlled ballot measure committee; 	3.	a City candidate’s professional expense committee (i.e., legal defense committee); or, 	4.	an independent political committee primarily formed to support or oppose one or more City candidates.

* Soliciting contributions can involve more than just sending letters asking for donations. Soliciting contributions also means hosting, co-hosting, or sponsoring a campaign event, and includes the following activities, even if you are only one member of a host committee for an event: 	1.	providing your home or office for a fundraising event (without charging market value); 	2.	providing goods or services at a fundraising event (without charging market value); 	3.	inviting people to attend a fundraising event; and, 	4.	giving a list of prospective invitees or contributors to the candidate or committee.	
* Hosting a campaign event does not include solely supplying your name to be used on the invitation to an event. This is commonly referred to as an “honorary host.”
