## Termination
### Help Box:

* Check this box only when you are sure that your firm will not have any lobbying activity for the rest of 	the calendar year. This box will terminate your lobbying firm status from the quarterly reporting period to the rest of calendar year.  * If you terminate your lobbying firm at this quarter reporting period, and then your firm is active again, you will have to file another Registration Form, and pay another registration fee for re-registering your lobbying firm including your lobbyist(s) and client(s).* You will not have filing obligation after filing a terminating quarterly report. For example, you file a terminating quarterly report for the 2nd quarter of 2021, and on that basis have no obligation to file a 3rd and 4th quarter report for {calendar_year}.

# Schedule A-1

### Question

What are the registered clients for whom the firm has lobbied/contacted City Officials at least once during the quarterly reporting period? 

### Help (Top)

List each registered client for whom the firm had at least one lobbying contact during the reporting period. 

### Help (button when client form is open)

* **Lobbyists, Clients, and Municipal Decisions.**
	*  Information on your lobbyists, clients, and the municipal decisions you lobby on is pre-populated on the based of your EC-601 registration filing. 
	*  **If you discover that a client, a municipal decision, or a person who lobbied on a decision was not previously identified on the firm’s Registration Form, you must amend the Registration Form (EC-601) immediately. All lobbyists, clients, and municipal decisions are required to be listed either on the firm’s initial Registration Form or on an amended Registration Form filed within 10 calendar days of lobbying.**

* **Total Compensation**

	1.	Include all amounts earned (to the nearest $1,000) for lobbying activities performed during the period, including amounts the firm became entitled to receive pursuant to a contingency fee agreement. 	2.	Include all amounts earned during the reporting period for lobbying activities performed on a contingency basis during a prior reporting period. 	3.	If you are reporting multiple municipal decisions for the same client, enter the compensation amount only once; you may leave the compensation field blank when reporting other decisions. 	4.	Enter “zero” if the client is a pro bono client.  	5.	Check the “contingency” box if the firm lobbied on a contingency basis during the reporting period but hasn’t yet become entitled to receive the contingent amount from the client. 	6.	Keep in mind that “lobbying activities” includes more than just lobbying. It also includes researching, monitoring, and other activities related to lobbying. Disclose the compensation earned for all “lobbying activities” during the reporting period. 	7.	Do not include compensation the firm received solely for “indirect” lobbying efforts, such as public relations and advertising. Such sums, if $5,000 or more in a calendar quarter, should be reported by the client as an “expenditure lobbyist.” Consult the Lobbying Manual or the Ethics Commission’s website for information regarding expenditure lobbyists.
 
* **Lobbying on Contingency Basis?**<br>
  Check the “contingency” box if the firm lobbied on a contingency basis during the reporting period but hasn’t yet become entitled to receive the contingent amount from the client. 

* **Municipal Decision and Outcomes Sought Reporting**<br>
	* The descriptions you provided on your Registration Form EC-601 will be automatically entered into your firm’s Quarterly Disclosure Reports. Therefore, if you provided general information regarding a municipal decision on your Registration Form, additional specific information concerning that decision must be added to the applicable Quarterly Disclosure Report. 
	* Supplement the information in the “Outcome Sought” field if necessary, to accurately reflect the client’s goals with respect to the specific municipal decision. For example, “passage of the Living Wage Ordinance,” or “the adoption of stricter laws and policies designed to reduce storm drain pollution.”

* **Identifying City Officials**<br>
 When identifying City Officials who were lobbied during the reporting period, you are only required to disclose contacts with specified officers and employees of the City and City agencies. Refer to the Ethics Commission website for lists of “City Officials: [https://www.sandiego.gov/ethics/documents/lobbyists](https://www.sandiego.gov/ethics/documents/lobbyists). Note that these lists are updated only periodically and may not contain the names of everyone who is currently a “City Official” under the Lobbying Ordinance.
	
# Schedule A-2

### Question

What are the registered clients for whom the firm has not lobbied/contacted City Officials during the quarterly reporting period?


### Help

* List each registered client for whom the firm had no lobbying contacts during the reporting period.

* **Contingency Fees**: What was the amount the firm received during this reporting period for a contingency payment for lobbying performed in a previous reporting period? If the firm became entitled to a contingency payment during the reporting period for lobbying performed in a previous reporting period, disclose the compensation earned; otherwise, enter 0.

# Schedule A Review

### Help

All clients registered in your EC-601 Registration Filing must be included either in Schedule A-1 or A-2. If any of the registered clients are no longer your clients, you must first file an amendment to form EC-601 to remove these clients before proceeding with your EC-603 quarterly filing.

# Schedule B
### Question

What activity expense was made by the firm or its lobbyists during the reporting period that exceeds $10 within the reporting period to benefit a City Official, or his or her immediate family? For each identified activity expense, fill out a separate entry.
### Help

* An “activity expense” means any payment made to, or on behalf of, any City Official or any member of a City Official’s immediate family, by a lobbying firm, or any of its lobbyists. Activity expenses include gifts, meals, consulting fees, salaries, and any other form of compensation to a City Official or a City Official’s immediate family, but do not include campaign contributions.   * For example, a $3,000 consulting fee paid to a Department Director’s spouse would be considered a reportable activity expense. If a lobbying firm hires a City Official or a member of his or her immediate family, disclose the approximate total amount of compensation provided to, or on behalf of, that individual during the reporting period, including bonuses and benefits. * City law limits gifts (e.g., meals, tickets to events) from lobbying firms and their lobbyists to an aggregate total of $10 per City Official within a calendar month.   * This means, for example, that if a lobbyist in your firm purchases an $8 sandwich for a particular City Official, neither the firm nor any of its lobbyists may purchase a $3 beverage for that official in the same calendar month. Because the Activity Expenses schedule requires only the reporting of activity expenses that exceed $10, your firm should have no gifts to report. * Tickets and invitations to events held for non-profit entities (e.g., the Chamber of Commerce, Father Joe’s Villages) are not considered “gifts” for purposes of the Lobbying Ordinance. Accordingly, they are not subject to the $10 limit and need not be reported on the Quarterly Report Form.   * Note, however, that such tickets and invitations may be considered “gifts” under the City’s Ethics Ordinance and could subject the recipient to that Ordinance’s gift limits, reporting requirements, and disqualification rules.

# Schedule C 

### Question

What are the names of each owner, compensated officer, lobbyist in the firm and sponsored committees who made contributions totaling $100 or more to a City candidate’s election committee or a City candidate’s (or elected official’s) professional expense committee, or to a committee primarily formed to support or oppose a City candidate during this quarter? For each identified contribution, fill out a separate entry.
### Help

* Complete this schedule if one or more of the firm’s owners, compensated officers, or lobbyists made contributions totaling $100 or more during the reporting period to a City candidate’s committee or to a committee primarily formed to support or oppose a City candidate. * Also fill out Schedule C if the firm itself (or any political committee or “PAC” sponsored by the firm) made contributions totaling $100 or more during the reporting period to a committee primarily formed to support or oppose a City candidate. * Also use Schedule C to report any contributions of $100 or more made to a candidate’s or elected official’s professional expense committee (i.e., legal defense committee) during the quarter. 

  * For example, Jane is a partner in a lobbying firm. In October, she writes a personal check for $250 and gives it to a candidate seeking office in an upcoming City election. Later that month, Jane’s firm writes a $5,000 check to a committee primarily formed to support a different City candidate. When the lobbying firm prepares its October-December disclosure report, it must identify the $250 and $5,000 contributions on Schedule C.
  * Do not use Schedule C to report contributions made to support a candidate-controlled ballot measure committee; use Schedule D instead. * Note that elected City Officials (the Mayor, City Councilmembers, and the City Attorney) are considered “candidates” for as long as they remain in office.   * For example, after Councilmember Lopez is sworn into office, she sends out mailers soliciting contributions to retire her campaign debt. Richard, one of the firm’s lobbyists, sends a personal check for $300 to Councilmember Lopez’ committee. Even though the Councilmember is now an officeholder, she is also still a “candidate,” and Richard’s firm must disclose the $300 contribution on its next quarterly disclosure report. * The term “candidate” also includes an elected City official running for office in a different jurisdiction.   * For example, a City Councilmember running for State Assembly is a “candidate” for purposes of these disclosure rules, and any contributions of $100 or more to the Councilmember’s Assembly campaign must be disclosed. * Only contributions from the same source with an aggregate total of $100 or more made during the quarter must be disclosed.   * For example, a lobbyist who made a $75 contribution to a committee does not need to disclose that contribution on Schedule C unless he or she made another contribution of $25 or more to the same committee in the same quarter (in which case both the $75 and $25 contributions would be disclosed separately on Schedule C). * Keep in mind that contributions made directly to a candidate are reportable, as are contributions to a committee that makes campaign expenditures independent of the candidate (i.e., a primarily formed recipient committee). When completing Schedule C, therefore, identify the full name of the committee to which the contribution was made, not just the name of the candidate. * Contributions made to oppose a candidate are also reportable.   * If, for example, a lobbyist contributes $200 to a committee entitled “Vote No on Smithers for City Council in 2016,” the firm must report that contribution on Schedule C. * The term “contribution” includes non-monetary, or “in-kind” payments. 
  * For example, a lobbyist who provides a candidate’s committee with $100 worth of office supplies has made a contribution that must be reported on Schedule C.

# Schedule D

### QuestionWhat are the names of each owner, compensated officer, lobbyist in the firm and sponsored committees who made contributions totaling $100 or more to a City ballot measure committee controlled by a City candidate or Officeholder during this quarter? For each identified contribution, fill out a separate entry. 
### Help* Complete this schedule if the firm or any of its owners, compensated officers, or lobbyists made contributions totaling $100 or more during the reporting period to a City ballot measure committee controlled by a City candidate. As indicated, elected City Officials are considered “candidates” under campaign laws for as long as they remain in office. * It is not difficult to determine if a candidate “controls” a ballot measure committee. Under the City’s campaign laws, when a candidate “controls” a committee, that candidate’s name must appear in the committee’s name and on all of the committee’s campaign literature, including its door hangers, mailers, and yard signs.
 * Only contributions from a single source with an aggregate total of $100 or more made during the quarter must be disclosed. A lobbyist who made a $75 contribution to a candidate-controlled committee does not need to disclose that contribution on Schedule D unless he or she made another contribution of $25 or more to the committee in the same quarter (in which case both the $75 and $25 contributions would be disclosed separately on Schedule D). 
  * For example, Oscar is one of the firm’s lobbyists. In August, he writes a personal check for $500 to support a City ballot measure that would increase in the City’s transient occupancy tax. He gives the check to a ballot measure committee controlled by Councilmember Jones. That same month, Oscar’s firm writes a check for $3,000 and gives it to a committee that supports the same ballot measure but is not controlled by a candidate. When the firm prepares its July-September disclosure report, it must identify Oscar’s $500 contribution. The $3,000 contribution made by Oscar’s firm does not need to be disclosed because its contribution went to a committee that was not controlled by a candidate.

# Schedule E

### QuestionDid the firm or any of its owners, compensated officers, or lobbyist engage in fundraising activities with an aggregate total of $2,000 or more during this quarter to support or oppose a candidate for City office or for a ballot measure committee controlled by a candidate? Please disclose each fundraising activity.

### Help

* “Fundraising activity” means soliciting, or directing others to solicit, campaign contributions from one or more contributors, either personally or by hosting or sponsoring a fundraising event, and either:   * (1) personally delivering $2,000 or more in contributions to a candidate, a candidate’s controlled committee, or a committee primarily formed to support a candidate, or   * (2) taking credit for the contribution by either personally delivering $2,000 or more in contributions to a candidate committee or identifying yourself to a candidate committee as having any degree of responsibility for it receiving $2,000 or more in contributions as a result of that solicitation.* A “candidate committee” means any of the following:  * a City candidate’s election campaign committee;   * a City candidate’s controlled ballot measure committee;   * a City candidate’s professional expense committee (i.e., legal defense committee); or,   * an independent political committee primarily formed to support or oppose one or more City candidates Soliciting contributions can involve more than just sending letters asking for donations.
   * Soliciting contributions also means hosting, co-hosting, or sponsoring a campaign event, and includes the following activities, even if you are only one member of a host committee for an event:   * providing your home or office for a fundraising event (without charging market value);   * providing goods or services at a fundraising event (without charging market value);   * inviting people to attend a fundraising event; and,   * giving a list of prospective invitees or contributors to the candidate or committee.
  * Hosting a campaign event does not include solely supplying your name to be used on the invitation to an event. This is commonly referred to as an “honorary host.” * When determining whether or not someone has reached the $2,000 threshold, keep in mind that the amount of contributions attributable to an individual is the total amount raised, even if that individual was one of several persons involved in a fundraising effort. Do not divide the total amount raised by the number of persons involved in the fundraising activities.   * For example, Mary is a partner in a firm that employs two lobbyists, John and Bill. Candidate Smith asks Mary, John, and Bill to help raise money for his campaign. Candidate Smith gives each of them a stack of remittance envelopes and asks them to help raise money for his campaign. Mary hosts a fundraiser at her house, collects $5,500 in contribution checks, and delivers them to Candidate Smith. John writes his name on a corner of each envelope and mails them to a dozen of his associates, asking them to place a contribution in the envelope and send it to the candidate. John later finds out (through his associates or the candidate) that those associates contributed a total of $2,000 to Candidate Smith. Bill calls ten of his friends and encourages them to go to Mary’s fundraiser. He takes no further action.
* When the firm prepares its quarterly disclosure report, it must identify Mary’s and John’s fundraising activities. Both solicited campaign contributions, and both made sure the candidate knew they were responsible for more than $2,000 in contributions. Bill’s fundraising activities do not need to be disclosed, even though he solicited his friends on behalf of Candidate Smith; he never obtained any credit for contributions that might have resulted from his solicitations.* Fundraising directly for a candidate is reportable, as is fundraising for a committee that makes campaign expenditures independent of the candidate (i.e., a primarily formed recipient committee). When completing Schedule E, therefore, identify the full name of the committee for which an individual engaged in fundraising activities, not just the name of the candidate. If you are not sure of the full name of a committee, you can search or browse for committee names in the City Clerk’s electronic filing system.* Keep in mind that fundraising to oppose a candidate is also reportable. If, for example, a lobbyist hosts a fundraiser for a committee entitled “Vote No on Smithers for City Council in 2016,” the firm must report that fundraising activity on Schedule E (assuming that the $2,000 threshold was reached). * Refer to the Ethics Commission’s Fact Sheet on Disclosure of Fundraising Activities for additional information: [https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/lobbyfundraising.pdf](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/lobbyfundraising.pdf)

# Schedule F

### QuestionWhat are the names of each owner, compensated officer, lobbyist of the firm who provided compensated campaign-related services to a candidate or a candidate-controlled committee (including a candidate-controlled ballot measure committee) during this quarter? For each identified individual, fill out a separate entry.

### Help

* Do not disclose volunteer work performed for a candidate. 
* Include campaign services that are provided pursuant to a contingency fee agreement, such as a “win bonus.” 
* Reportable services include those that are related to the candidate seeking office or to a ballot measure committee controlled by the candidate. The services must be performed in exchange for a salary, bonus, or some other form of economic consideration.  * For example, Tim is a professional campaign consultant. During non-election years, he works for clients who pay him to lobby City officials. Accordingly, he registers as a lobbying firm. In November, he starts working on a campaign for a Councilmember seeking re-election the following year. When he prepares his firm’s October-December disclosure report, he must disclose his campaign activities, including the name of the candidate and the office that candidate Page 10 of 10 is seeking, the approximate amount of compensation he earned during the reporting period, and a description of the campaign services he provided during the reporting period.   * Another example: Aidan is a lobbyist who worked on a Mayoral candidate’s campaign under an agreement that he would volunteer his services but be entitled to a “win bonus” in the amount of $2,500 if the candidate won the election. The candidate won the election in November and paid Aidan the $2,500 in January of the following year. When completing its fourth quarter report, the firm will report the $2,500 that Aidan earned in the quarter, even though the actual payment wasn’t made until the first quarter of the following year. The firm will not report the payment on its first quarter report for the following year. * The term “candidate” includes an elected City official running for office in a different jurisdiction. For example, a City Councilmember running for State Assembly is a “candidate” for purposes of these disclosure rules.* **If the individual identified has not yet earned any compensation but could be entitled to a contingency based form of compensation in the future (e.g., a “win bonus”), check the contingency box.**

# Schedule G

### QuestionWhat are the names of each owner, compensated officer, lobbyist of the firm who provided compensated services under a contract either as an employee, consultant, or independent contractor with the City of San Diego during this quarter? For each identified individual, fill out a separate entry.

### Help

* Use this schedule to report contracting services by the firm or any of its lobbyist, compensated officers, or owners for the City of San Diego.
  * If, for example, one of the firm’s partners was hired by the Mayor’s office to provide consulting services in connection with outsourcing a City function, then the firm must report these consulting services.

* Note that “City” includes all of the City’s departments, agencies (such as Civic San Diego and the Housing Commission), boards, and commissions.  * For example, Malcolm is a lobbyist in a lobbying firm, and he specializes in environmental matters. Because of his expertise, the City’s Environmental Services Department retains him as a consultant to evaluate the impact of a proposed hazardous waste program. Malcolm starts and completes the contract in March. He submits a bill for $2,500 and he is paid in April. When his firm prepares its January-March quarterly disclosure report, it must report that (1) Malcolm provided services to the City; (2) the services were provided to the Environmental Services Department; (3) Malcolm earned $2,500 for the services he provided; and (4) Malcolm’s work involved evaluating the environmental impact of a proposed hazardous waste program. Note: when the firm prepares its April-June quarterly disclosure report, it need not disclose this consulting contract even though the payment was received in April (because the payment was “earned” and reported in the prior quarter).
